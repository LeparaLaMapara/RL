## Agent

An agent is like the central character in the world of RL. It's the decision-maker that interacts with its environment to achieve its goals.

### Example

Imagine training a robot to navigate a maze. The robot is the agent, making choices on how to move to find the maze's exit.

## Environment

The environment is the stage where the RL drama unfolds. It's everything outside the agent that the agent can perceive and interact with.

### Example

In the maze scenario, the environment encompasses the maze itself - the walls, paths, and the exit. The robot (agent) interacts with this maze.

## State

A state is like a snapshot of the environment at a particular moment. It encapsulates all the information the agent needs to make decisions.

### Example

In the maze, a state would involve the robot's current position, nearby walls, and distance to the exit. This information guides the robot's movement choices.

## Action

Actions are the decisions the agent takes to transition between states. These are the agent's way of affecting the environment.

### Example

In the maze, the robot's actions are its movements: up, down, left, or right at each intersection.

## Reward

Rewards are the agent's feedback for its actions. They indicate how good or bad an action was in terms of achieving the agent's goal.

### Example

In the maze, moving closer to the exit yields positive rewards, while hitting walls results in negative rewards. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards.
